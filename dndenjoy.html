    <!-- Unfortunatly, I wasn't able to use the <script> tag because the original platform I was using to code, khan academy, doesn't host a server that I can use for that specific tag.

    <p class="GrenzeGotischfont">Maryako is the made-up language I well, <em>made up,</em> and I hope to include it more in the game. So, I am now showing you how to speak it! I will be using IPA to describe the sounds, and it can get confusing. For example, 
    <span style="font-family: sans-serif">[r]</span> looks like it's pronounced like our english, "r" sound, but no, <span style="font-family: sans-serif">[r]</span> is actually a rolled r. <span style="font-family: sans-serif">[ɹ] or </span> is our english "r" sound. So unless you already now IPA, consider finding out the consonant sounds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_pulmonic_consonant_chart_with_audio">here</a> and the vowel sounds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio">here</a> By the way, I will tell you at the end of the table which IPA consonant symbols are pronounced the same is english as they are in IPA.
