1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,090
Everybody, this is Coder Henry B H, and I have

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,360
well, I mostly developed a

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:15,180
version of scratch coding its block coding, but

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,860
I just want to show you I just want to help you

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,710
understand exactly what typed coding is.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,680
Typed coding is kind of a phrase I made up, but it's

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,410
exactly what it is. It's typed code. So one of

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,590
these is JavaScript and I'm just going to give you

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,580
an example. scratch we would to do an equation.

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,440
We have an equation block. It's a green block or

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,560
so blank plus blank. And then we would put that in

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,730
a say. So one flag clicked say blah blah, blah,

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,580
blah, blah, blah, blah. In this case, we're going

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,770
to use nine plus five

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,880
and so on JavaScript we would do that println(data);

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,210
we put the data that we want to do the

17
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,440
equation in five plus nine and it would write it

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,220
as 14 on the screen, um, not in code on this part

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,570
of the code. So

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,290
I'm just going to show you what my typed version

21
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,300
of Scratch, which I'm going to call TSCL

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:33,900


23
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:45,060
typed scratch computer language TSCL.

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:59,940
it's pronounced /tsil/.

25
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:08,570
That is the um this right here is the IPA and it's

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,580
exactly it's TSCL. OK, all right. Let's go

27
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,430
ahead and start typing this. So

28
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,310
this, this starts everything off. When I have that

29
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,340
a

30
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,620
dollar sign I'm going to go and start typing in

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,960
here. So we're going to um there these things

32
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,210
where I can go like this.

33
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,130
So anybody reading this who actually knows the

34
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,680
language, they will be like, oh yeah, this block

35
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,460
has to do with, um, sound or if it's like this. Oh

36
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,260
yeah. This book definitely has to do with, uh,

37
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,880
looks and oh no, this has to do with motion et

38
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,260
cetera. Well actually it's mostly just those three

39
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,170
for anything else, like an event block we could do

40
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,380
event because those that there's question

41
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,830
exclamation marks are comments. And if maybe

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,880
there's a block that looks the same as another

43
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,100
block, but it's for a different thing and a

44
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,070
different type of block, we could tell the

45
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,490
computer what it is. I mean, you don't usually

46
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,760
need to do that, but we would do this. So we would

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,070
say event. It also helps the reader, but it also

48
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,910
helps the computer. I could write whatever I want

49
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,550
in this comment. It's not really code. So I could

50
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:59,310
write, I could write, "I love scratch"

51
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,960
I could write, um,

52
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,780
I could even write this.

53
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,600
Which is the symbol for which is the hide block,

54
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,660
and it wouldn't do anything because it's comenting

55
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,730
right back. OK, so I'm just going to go ahead and

56
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,140
show you what it's going to be like. So we're

57
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,890
going to go ahead and put that here. We're going

58
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,670
to do I want to tell the reader that this is a

59
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,390
hide block. So hide, I mean,

60
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,570
a looks block. And then we're going to go and put

61
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,360
this here and then we're going to put a semicolon

62
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,240
to tell them that it's the end of a block. Then we

63
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,580
have to know.

64
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,400
Go and do this, and then we're going to do this

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,790
again, but let's say I don't I want to make a

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,800
comment. No, no, I need to tell the computer so.

67
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,860
OK, and so if you know JavaScript.

68
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,590
You probably knew about the separating words with

69
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,970
capital letters thing,

70
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,040
which I'm going to use in the scratch. OK, so and

71
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,580
what we have to put this thing in here now in

72
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,160
order to tell the computer that it's

73
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,050
that it's kind of a drop down thing. It's got some

74
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,420
choices. We have to put this signs, anything like

75
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,830
this for this we're going to put in for this. Here,

76
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,040
let me speak. Hello? Are you going to put an

77
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,810
ampersand? Now, this is the same, but we're going

78
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,870
to put a hash tag or number sign because this is a

79
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,150
number if we were. But we're not to that point yet.

80
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,810
So we're going to put this hash. I mean, present

81
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,970
here. We want to put thank you. And then, uh, and

82
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,700
a block and now we're going to write this and all

83
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,620
that good computer. I think the computer knows

84
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,260
this. So reach and then we have to put the numbers

85
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,110
in here, but we don't have to we could just put

86
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,490
the regular ampersand, but it it helps the

87
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,680
computer know that it's specifically in number and

88
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,940
it could sometimes work wrong. So zero point five.

89
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,120
Seconds.

90
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,330
Um.

91
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:04,800
And, Brooke, um, and really we can just use curly

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,540
brackets like this.

93
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,820
Or if you're in a typewriter, uh, I could just do

94
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,930
this because typewriters don't actually help this,

95
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,500
the brackets or curly brackets. So we're going to

96
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,250
put, um, but we're going to do creeley records

97
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,870
because this is a computer, um, probably work

98
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,710
better. I make computer less confused. All right.

99
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,100
So that should wait. And then we're going to go

100
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,650
and show. No show.

101
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,950
And switch costume to

102
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,090
and then because it's kind of a drop down thing,

103
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,490
we got to do that present sign

104
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:15,760
and then name, costume one and block.

105
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,730
And switch. Back

106
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,260
drop to.

107
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,650
Left talking

108
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,460
now, because this is kind of a special ad on block,

109
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,480
there's a special we have to write a special line

110
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,640
of code, namely

111
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,700
the.

112
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,970
The following.

113
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,550
They have to reach following

114
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:20,180
is more than regular, then we have to put some

115
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,190
brackets.

116
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,340
Right, and then let's go ahead and put that block

117
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,520
in there and then now we have to actually tell us

118
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:39,620
what what it is. And so we have to do this.

119
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:54,810
Aalto, wait, no, uh, it's the text to speech at

120
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,400
Unblock. OK, and then we're going to do search.

121
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,910
Voice.

122
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,240
To.

123
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,200
Also.

124
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,120
And now we're going to finish the special blocks

125
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,730
and then we're going to speak. Then now this is

126
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,270
texture. We're going to use an ampersand. Hello,

127
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,400
how are you?

128
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,020
And block, OK? And they were going to broadcast

129
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,940
message one, OK?

130
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,900
Broadcast.

131
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:07,740
Message one, go ahead and finish that, and then

132
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,990
we're going to put two semicolons here. And what

133
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,110
if what if it's spinning? What if, of course,

134
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,810
you're going to want to write code most project

135
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,590
for multiple

136
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:32,230
sprites so you can't choose slashes Sprite name.

137
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,370
So this is for Sprite one. And then we're going to

138
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,530
finish this Sprite one code with two back slashes

139
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,160
and we can actually go back to it. So let's say

140
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,340
one does right to.

141
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,830
And then

142
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,910
I clicked.

143
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,750
All right.

144
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,270
And then we're going to know it's not one flight

145
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,320
glitch when

146
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,620
we see.

147
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,690
Receive.

148
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,550
Message.

149
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,550
One, and then we can actually we don't actually

150
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,410
need to do that because it's it's got this here,

151
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,730
which tells, OK,

152
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,340
we're going to read it for everything. It doesn't

153
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,680
we don't need to do this. It would actually mess

154
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,110
up the code if we did this, because we have this

155
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,250
it it tells when when something happens, we need

156
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:07,700
to do this. And when you do that, this would mess

157
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,090
everything up. And it would the computer wouldn't

158
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,850
be able to read it and it would be like, OK,

159
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,790
everything and anything even outside of it to none

160
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,680
of the code would run. So and then so now we need

161
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,970
to do when I received message one, we're going to

162
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,050
and then we're going to show.

163
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,480
Show

164
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,880
and then wait.

165
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,320
Which is zero point five seconds

166
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,070
and.

167
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,470
Hide, but let's say when I do this multiple times,

168
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,260
so.

169
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:14,550
Repeat. Three. And we're actually just going to do

170
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,200
that,

171
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,800
but we actually need regular black records for

172
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,310
this.

173
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,740
Regular brak, regular brackets and repeat, let me

174
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,250
repeat three times, so.

175
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,260
Oops.

176
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:49,600
OK, and then we're going to broadcast, broadcast,

177
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,990
mis broadcast.

178
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:06,850
Impassioned message to know we're going to end the

179
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,530
code for that spring and then let's say we're

180
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,180
going to go back to spray one again,

181
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,110
I know we can actually go back and forth, so.

182
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,790
This is Sprite once code, but it can also be got

183
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,900
to do this can also but, um.

184
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:44,540
Whatever I put me here is also Sprite one, so we

185
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,200
can actually go back and forth, back and forth,

186
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,120
and that's what's so cool and we can also just

187
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,530
comment doesn't even have to be in a block. So but

188
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,530
if it is, we need to put it. But if it isn't, we

189
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,530
need to put that there. So let's say hello.

190
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,690
How are you

191
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,480
now, I know, and so we can only put exclamation

192
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,940
marks inside of a comment when it's so actually

193
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,090
when that happens, we need to put two of these

194
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,490
here to tell it, OK?

195
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,630
The comment only stops at this exclamation mark.

196
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,570
That actually depends on what version in the

197
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,360
latest version. I haven't actually published it. I

198
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,140
don't know how to program everything to actually

199
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,250
make the programming language. But, um, you could

200
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,610
actually put it. You can't do it in a block, OK?

201
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,320
You can't do it here. That won't work because it

202
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,540
will shut down all the code below here because you

203
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,230
can't read it there. But anyways.

204
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,350
So.

205
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:18,740
Let's go ahead and

206
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,590
write this,

207
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,440
and then we're going to do. Luks say.

208
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,840
Ampersand, good bye.

209
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,710
OK, so then to end the entire script, we're going

210
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,310
to do.

211
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,610
SEAL, by the way, to start the script, we're going

212
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:01,820
to do the same thing. It will only read two of

213
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,930
these. So if you have three of these, then it's

214
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:06,980
going to be like.

215
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,870
Oh, no, bug, and it's going to shut down all the

216
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,980
code should only put this twice so seal

217
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,140
and then it ends here. So let's go through this

218
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:31,070
again. One flood and one one flood claimed hide,

219
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,540
and until the computers looks and I'm not going to

220
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:41,200
switch back drop to thank you. Wait, it's a no. As

221
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,480
you point five seconds, show switch costumes, your

222
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,400
costume, one switch back to your left talking and

223
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,540
then the following is more than regular. And then

224
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,200
that's only for the special box. And then it means

225
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,300
we got to tell it to a special block. Curly

226
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:02,900
brackets

227
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,130
set voice to allow to speak. Hello, how are you?

228
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,510
I'm not going to broadcast message one. We're

229
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,430
ending that code here. Um.

230
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,750
That's actually

231
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,940
right, and we're ending that Sprite Sprite, too,

232
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,910
when I receive message one, we're going to repeat

233
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,310
this third time we're going to show and then we

234
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,820
have a second and then hide and then show that we

235
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,060
have a second hide and then we're going to

236
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,100
broadcast message 2 That's the end of this.

237
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,910
And then that's the end of that Sprite when Sprite

238
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,300
one. Oh, no.

239
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,060
There's a mistake that I actually did on purpose,

240
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,280
maybe you caught it earlier.

241
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:05,240
And realize we would know, but you're still if

242
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,290
you're still learning, you might forget to do this.

243
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,010
Let's get to this.

244
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,310
You forgot to do that. OK, so I get that mistake

245
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,630
on purpose, maybe you caught it, maybe you didn't.

246
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,490
That's fine if for those who didn't. It's just an

247
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,380
important reminder. If this ever does get

248
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,000
published, maybe it will. I'm sure a fifth grader

249
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,080
as of making this,

250
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,040
but it's essentially the same as this. It's just a

251
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,240
modified a little to be typed. And I hope you

252
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,930
enjoyed this TSCL tutorial. So let's do one more

253
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,220
thing. Anything outside of it's the last TSCL, but

254
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,590
that's not important.

255
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,250
I'm going to.

256
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:36,000
And he said, I hope you enjoy this TSCL, I hope

257
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
you enjoyed the TSCL.

258
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,150
Bye.
